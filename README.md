# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is my first project that focuses on using HTML, css, and Javascript together.  


## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- Chance

Here are some screenshots of the project:

The first screenshot shows the app in full desktop mode, with the profile on the left, and the text input and posteed tweets on the right.

The second screenshot shows the app in a smaller format. Notice how the header has now moved to the top of the page.

The third screenshot shows the app in the same smaller format, only having scrolled down.  The navigation bar remains fixed to the top!
